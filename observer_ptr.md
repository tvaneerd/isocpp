Summary
-------

In P1408, Bjarne wrote a rebuttal against standardizing `observer_ptr`, but no one had yet written a proposal to standardize it. Thus the need for this "prebuttal":

**`observer_ptr`** (from Library Fundamentals 2 TS) **should be standardized** (but with a better name and better conversions).


Reasons to standardize
----------------------

Reasons to standardize `observer_ptr` (with more in-depth explanations to follow).

1. `observer_ptr` is the safe **_common type_** for `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, other smart pointers, and `T*`.
2. `observer_ptr` is a **_safer alternative to `T*`_**
3. `observer_ptr` **_extends the type safety_** of `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` (and other smart pointers)
4. `observer_ptr` makes **_intent_** more **_clear_**
5. `observer_ptr` helps prevent overuse of `shared_ptr` as a function param
6. `observer_ptr` is a post-modern tool for **_transitioning a codebase_** to more modern C++.

Personally, I come across these uses _weekly_.  Note that I listed the oft-sited "transitioning a codebase" as sixth in order of importance (IMO).

Details/Explanations of each:

### 1. `observer_ptr` is the safe **_common type_** for `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, other smart pointers, and `T*`.

`observer_ptr` for smart and raw pointers, is like `string_view` for `char const *` and `string`.  
ie a common base type that any pointer can be temporarily safely converted to.

- The leftmost version has calls to `get()` which require extra scrutiny in a code review (as you are removing a safety latch)
- We will likely never allow smart pointers to implicitly convert to raw pointers
- The leftmost function `f` (taking a raw pointer) also requires extra scrutiny.
- The middle version is just noisy - for no good reason - the noise does not protect anything dangerous.
- The rightmost version is safe - `observer_ptr` doesn't change ownership semantics. Nothing extra should be required.
- In terms of P0705 conversion guidelines, an implicit conversion to `observer_ptr` is safe and sensible.

_Why isn't `T*` the common type?_

You don't want smart pointers to implicitly convert to raw pointers
(as this can too easily lead to accidental misownership), but converting to `observer_ptr` does not increase the risk of misownership.
It does increase risk of dangling - same as string_view does.  Thus, similar to `string_view`, `observer_ptr` is best used as a function param.

### 2. `observer_ptr` is a **_safer alternative to `T*`_**

As mentioned in recent emails on the reflector, `T*` has some downsides:

- `T*` allows `++`, `--`, and `[i]` even when it shouldn't
- `T*` allows derived/base conversions (and then more `++`/`--` with the wrong size)
- `T*` `<` is not a total order
- `T*` opens up questions about ownership (in many codebases)
- `T*` allows conversion to `void *`
- `reinterpret_cast`
- etc

### 3. `observer_ptr` **_extends the type safety of other smart pointers_**

A smart pointer, when used correctly, ensures safe lifetime management. The only (well almost only) way to break the safety of a smart pointer, is improper use of `get()`.  Since `get()` exposes the underlying pointer, it exposes the responsibility of the smart pointer's invariants, breaking the "air-tight seal" of the smart pointer.

`observer_ptr` avoids `get()` and allows the invariant to stay protected throughout more code. A function that previously used a raw pointer (so as to be used by both `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` clients), can now avoid `get()` completely.  This means `get()` can be pushed to the edge of your codebase - only needed at the border with 3rd party or unchangeable APIs that require other pointer types.

`observer_ptr` extends the safety net of a smart pointer over more of your codebase.

### 4. `observer_ptr` makes **_intent_** more **_clear_**

From the original proposal (N4282) "it is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types, with the advantage that,  as a vocabulary type, it indicates its intended use without need for detailed analysis by code readers". `observer_ptr` makes code more clear, easier to read, alleviating nagging lifetime questions. Some codebases can use `T*` to mean non-owning, but many popular 3rd party libraries still use raw pointers with various meanings, thus adding ambiguity to even modern codebases.

### 5. `observer_ptr` helps prevent overuse of `shared_ptr` as a function param.

It is very common, in a codebase using `shared_ptr` (for sharing, hopefully), to pass `shared_ptr` as a function param.  Basically "I have a shared_ptr to Foo. I need to write a function that uses it.  I'll pass *it* into the function:"
```
int count(shared_ptr<Foo> foo);
```

There are 2 problems with this:
- it does not show intent - there is no intent to share ownership (beyond the length of the call).  ie vs a function like `setFoo(shared_ptr<Foo> foo)` which probably does intend to share ownership
- it involves unnecessary atomic increment/decrement - Photoshop, for example, changed all functions like this to instead take `shared_ptr<Foo> const & foo`, to avoid the atomic ops. Effective, but convoluted for a pointer.

`observer_ptr<Foo>` is a drop-in replacement for these functions. (`Foo *` is a replacement that has other issues as mentioned elsewhere, and also requires updating all call-sites, whereas `observer_ptr` does not require changes to callsites.)

I feel it will be easier to teach/train/convince/remind developers to use `observer_ptr` here than `T *` as `observer_ptr` is basically "made to order" for this usecase, and doesn't require extra thought.

### 6. `observer_ptr` is a post-modern tool for **_transitioning a codebase_** to more modern C++.

This is the reasoning most often discussed. Note that it is listed _fifth_. The idea is to review all raw pointers in a codebase, replacing each case with the correct smart pointer (ie `unique_ptr` hopefully, else `shared_ptr`, etc).
Since this replacement takes time, and not all cases will be fixed at once, "unowned" pointers need a thing to be replaced with (ie `observer_ptr`) else it is hard to know which raw pointers have been reviewed, and which haven't.
(If *all* owned pointers in a codebase are wrapped with smart pointers,
then a raw pointer can mean "unowned". But most codebases are still mixed with new and old uses.)

Postbuttal
---------

Rebuttal rebuttal:  There was concern about the potential proliferation of smart pointers in the standard. Although there are a few other potential smart pointers not (yet) in the standard (ie an intrustive_ptr, see P0468), smart pointers have been around for about 20 years, and there really isn't that much variation.  Boost has shared_ptr and intrusive_ptr, many codebases have something like observer_ptr. There is also inout_ptr (P1132), which can be found in many codebases (and is not really a smart pointer, but more of a helper, working alongside smart pointers), and also a clone_ptr or value_ptr, now called polymorphic_value (P0201).  But the list of common, widely used (and thus candidates for standardization) smart pointers is finite and short.  Ironically, the more we have, the more useful `observer_ptr` becomes as a common type that works seemlessly with all of them.


Changes
-------

Before standardizing `observer_ptr`, we should make a few small changes (more in-depth below)

1. Allow **_implicit conversions from smart and raw pointers_**
2. **_Rename/remove `release()`_** (as it does not transfer ownership)
3. **_Rename `observer_ptr`_**


### 1. Allow **_implicit conversions from smart and raw pointers_**

The original proposal did not include implicit conversions.  Most coding guidelines now favour `explicit` constructors - _when in doubt_; however, in the case of `observer_ptr`, there is no danger in an implicit conversion, only benefit.
See the table earlier in this paper - implicit conversion is required to allow `f(observer_ptr<T>)` to take smart pointers and raw pointers without calls to `get()`.  See P0705 for a more complete explanation as to when implicit conversion is acceptable. `observer_ptr` checks all the right boxes.  In particular:
- a smart/raw pointer and an `observer_ptr` both represent the same "platonic" thing (or `observer_ptr` is a strict subset of a pointer, since it offers a subset of functionality). Thus conversion (of some form) is worth considering.
- the conversion is safe. The `observer_ptr` won't delete the pointer, etc.  For a smart-pointer, conversion to `observer_ptr` does *not* break the smart-pointer's invariants. (whereas `get()` on a smart-pointer _does_ break (or expose for breakage) a smart pointer's invariants).  There is a slight concern with dangling (the `observer_ptr` doesn't extend the lifetime of the pointer), but this is the exact same level of concern (and same risk/reward) as with `string_view`.

This change has been implemented a few implementations without issue.


### 2. **_Rename/remove `release()`_** (as it does not transfer ownership)

`unique_ptr` has a `release()` function, which transfers ownership. Note that `shared_ptr` does NOT have a `release` function (as you don't gain exclusive ownership from the shared pointer). 

`observer_ptr::release()` **does not transfer ownership**.  It should be consistent with STL `shared_ptr`, and not have this function.

In any programming language, it is important that **_Different semantics require different names_** but it is particluarly important in a language with templates that use compile-time duck-typing.  If `release()` is called in a template, the expectation would be ownership transfer.

`release` can be renamed `detach` or just removed - the user can call `get()` then `reset()`.

(P.S. same with `retain_ptr::release()` (P0468), although its semantics are even subtler - the reference count lives with the raw pointer, not the smart pointer, and only responsibility is being transferred.)


### 3. **_Rename `observer_ptr`_**

Naming
------

`observer_ptr` is a bad name.  It is bad because "observer" already has common meaning in programming (ie "the observer pattern" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
`observer_ptr` is thus a great name to use throughout this paper, as it is a only a placeholder, not a suggestion, and thus doesn't bias to any of the other good names to follow.

Criteria:

There are some criteria to use when considering naming:

- Not understanding is better than MISunderstanding.  (“It is better to know nothing than to know what ain’t so.” - Josh Billings, 1874)
- Coining a term is OK - it will forever have that meaning (ie "observer" means observer pattern). The hard part is finding a good term not already used - an arbitrary term (like _iota_) is not good "coinage" (but it does show how coining a term - attaching meaning - works). A coined term should at least contain a hint that our brains can cling to.
- Avoid negatives, as these quickly lead to double negatives in code (ie `if (!noSoup)...`)
- Avoid spoken ambiguity.  ie `raw_ptr` vs "raw pointer".

A list of names
---------------

Mostly the following names can be grouped into a few piles:

* OWNERSHIP: smart pointers tend to be about ownership.  This one is lack of ownership.  But the pointer is still owned (hopefully!), just not by you.  So `unowned_ptr`, for example, is not correct (as _someone_ owns it); `notmy_ptr` is more correct.
* USAGE: Instead of defined-by-contrast (ie vs other smart pointers), we could focus on how it is meant to be used - it is best used as a param (like string_view) and is only temporary. Thus names like temp/brief/transient/sojourn/... It is also meant to grant _access_ to an object, no-more-no-less, thus `access_ptr`.
* WHAT: We can define a class by what it is and what it offers, and let users decide how to use it.
* COINAGE: Picking a word that is currently unused, and give it meaning in the programming context.  But it should at least hint at meaning.
